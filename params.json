Define exactly what you need in a way that is easy to read and to write. Linq.js will make sure it does only as much work as it needs to; by optimizing every single step of the combined query to produce just what is needed for the final result, the total processing time can be kept at a minimum.\r\n\r\n### Familiar syntax from .NET LINQ\r\nIf you have experience with the established .NET LINQ system and its extension methods, using Linq.js will feel natural to you. The method signatures are designed to closely match the .NET signatures while adhering to common Javascript conventions.\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\nAfter downloading and extracting the zipped repository you will find the `linq.js` file in the `dist` folder. Add this file to your project to gain access to the global `linq` object that serves as your entry point for making use of the library. Make sure to use the minified version `linq.min.js` for production. Check the contents of the `docs` folder of the repository for a detailed documentation generated by jsdoc.",
