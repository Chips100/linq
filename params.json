If you want to filter elements from a list of one million items that satisfy a certain condition and later on only need the first ten results, you do not want to check the condition for all items first just to throw the rest away. Chaining multiple transformations on a source sequence throughout different parts of the code to produce a result set is a common operation when working with data. Having an optimized way to create such constructs can simplify your code and speed up the development while preventing performance bottlenecks resulting from unnecessary operations. Linq.js provides an approach to tackle this problem that is easy to learn and adopt. It lets you build queries upon your source sequences that only start evaluating the items when it needs to. \r\n\r\n### Familiar syntax from .NET LINQ\r\nIf you have experience with the established .NET LINQ system and its extension methods, using Linq.js will feel natural to you. The method signatures are designed to closely match the .NET signatures while adhering to common Javascript conventions.\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\nDownload and extract the zipped repository with the Download link on the top of this page. There are two Javascript files in the `dist` folder - an unminified version for development purposes and a minified version for production. Reference the appropriate file in your project to make use of the global `linq` object that serves as your entry point for making use of the library. Check the contents of the `docs` folder for a detailed documentation generated by jsdoc.",
