Used string representation of elements in distinct, union and intersect.
To have some kind of optimization by using faster lookups.

Problem: What if a comparer is supplied, that makes two objects equal, although their string representations are not???
We have to kick out this lookup thing unfortunately.
some hash algorithm would be cool.
Maybe we can have optionally accept comparer which offer functions for equality check and hashing???
